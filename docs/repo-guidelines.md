# Repository Guidelines

Because the projects are provided "as-is" per the [licensing terms](../license.txt) there is no guarenteed response whenever an Issue is reported or question posted. In some cases, the owners/admins may reach out to you directly in response to an issue/question and coordinate other means to share data as needed.

## Contribution Guidelines
We welcome contributions to this repository. Please follow these guidelines below:

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests can be created by any user wanting to contribute to the repo. The owners/admins of the repo will approve pull requests as changes are reviewed and will determine if changes meet the intent of the repository.

## Issues and Discussions in Github

The Issues and Discussions features of GitHub will be used as the primary means of communication.  An issue may be a bug report or identifying an issue found with a project. When creating or working issues, contributors are encouraged to use permalinks to link to other files in a repo.  Crosslinking of issues, when they are related, is also encouraged. When creating pull requests that resolve issues, include the Issue as a cross link in the PR.

If there is a question about how to use the SDK or sync service, recommended feature request, or general inquiries should be made in the Discussions section of the repo.
